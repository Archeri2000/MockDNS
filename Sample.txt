# HOW TO USE
#
# This file is a sample on how to format dns entries for mocking
# Any line starting with # is treated as a comment and ignored
#
# Every non-comment line will only be properly processed if it contains two elements: an IP address(IPv4 or IPv6) and a Domain name separated by a space
# e.g.
# 1.1.1.1 sample.com
# fe23:2001::1 sample
#
# Additionally, you can use localhost or localhostv6 as the IP
# e.g.
# localhost test.website -> 127.0.0.1 test.website
# localhostv6 web.test -> ::1 web.test
#
# Do not include a port(e.g. localhost:50) as that is an invalid IP address for the DNS entry and will be rejected by the command.
